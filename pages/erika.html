                erika. essentials. actually quite essential. front to back no skips. and stands the test of time, been listening
                since it came out in 2019.

                erika is in that half black european girl vein. like okaykaya. i should add kaya to rarities.

                idk what it's like in europe man. erika is my gateway. <br>
                idk how i came across her but she was making her 
                way around the ethos around that time. in a very specific
                pocket of iykyk. corniness of how that sounds aside.
